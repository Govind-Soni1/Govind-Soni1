    <p>Sthala purana – After many years of tapasya by Sandilya maharshi, Mahadev blessed him by manifesting as a Swayambhu shivalingam, as Sri Siddeshwara Swamy. It is said that everyday between midnight and 3 am, many rishis and devatas do Pooja to Siddeshwara Swamy. It is said that the pranava naadam can be heard by mahatmas during this period. Kanchi kamakoti peetadhipati Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekara Saraswati Swamiji had been blessed with hearing this pranava naadam. He told everyone of the greatness of Sri Siddeshwara Swamy here and said that the wishes of devotees will be fulfilled here. It is said that 9 aushadha siddis did tapasya here and were blessed by Siddeshwara. So this is holy land.</p>
