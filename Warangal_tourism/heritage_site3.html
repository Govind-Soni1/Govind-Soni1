        <p> The Sri Vidya Saraswathi Shaneeshwara, warangal (or) Wargal Saraswati Temple is dedicated to Goddess Saraswati Devi. The garbhagriha is located at a level nearly equivalent to the third floor. The Goddess is seen to be in full glory decorated with a lot of jewels and garlands and adorned in a saree. There is an idol of Goddess about 10 feet high in front of the temple, which is a magnificent piece of art.

            The other temples in the complex are Sri Lakshmi Ganapathi, Lord Shanishwara and Lord Shiva. There are two Vaishnava Temples here, which are almost in ruins as of now. These two Vaishnava Temples are said to have been built during the reign of the Kakatiya rulers. A huge victory pillar is also located nearby. With a height of about 30 feet, it has statues of Lord Rama, Goddess Sita, Lord Lakshmana and Goddesses Lakshmi over it. The temple has a Veda Paathashaala on its premises where many students learn Vedas.</p>
