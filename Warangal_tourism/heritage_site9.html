    <p>Khush Mahal, another popular place to visit in Warangal, presents city’s ancient grandeur. It has been built within the walls of Warangal fort, presenting an opportunity for tourists to club both the sightseeing place in one visit. Khush Mahal, withstanding the havoc of time, presents an impressive architecture.

        Khush Mahal is said to be built during Tughlak reign in 14th century. It is also considered to be built on the old palatial complex of Kakatiya reign. Traces of Tughlak architectural style is still seen on this structure. For instance, the walls of the Mahal which are slightly inclined are indicative of the structural style of that period. However, according to some it was built by Shitab Khan, the then Warangal Governor of Qutub Shahi Dynasty. He then used Khush Mahal as an auditorium. Hence, it is also known by the name of Shitab Khan Mahal.</p>
