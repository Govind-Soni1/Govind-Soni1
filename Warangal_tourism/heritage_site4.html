        <p> The Ramappa Lake, locally known as the great Ramappa Cheruvu, is one of the most prominent reservoirs that has been turned by Telangana Tourism into an area of retreat in the district of Warangal. The story of Ramappa Lake is set in the early 13th century. This waterbody was carved out of the great Jampanna Vagu by King Ganapathi, a ruler of the Kakatiyan dynasty to bring an increase in the distribution of water and drinking and irrigation purposes to the different areas of his kingdom.

            Today, Ramappa Lake is an active tourist destination set in one of the most picturesque surroundings with views to die for. The tourism department of Telangana has also established various entertainment activities like paddle boating, motor boating and an exclusive space specified for various food vendors for visitors to enjoy the authentic street food of Telangana.</p>

        <p>The very beautiful Ramappa Lake is perfectly crafted to situate between the hills of Warangal that caters to offer a picture-perfect view of the lake. Along with its breathtaking surroundings, the lake also is surrounded by a very calm breeze that gently flows throughout the day leading to a pleasant climate for all visitors. This calming waterbody is situated about one kilometre from the main Shiva Temple of the district, the Ramalingeshwar or Ramappa Temple near Palampet. Well connected by roads, it is located at an approximate distance of 240 km from the heart of Telangana, Hyderabad and around 70 km from Warangal. Tourists from all over India frequently visit the great Ramappa Temple for spiritual as well as architectural purposes. The temple houses the history of the Kakatiyan dynasty and is therefore a pure representation of their style of architecture.</p>
